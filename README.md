## Build Instructions

Clone the git repo (or unzip the released zip file) into your Adobe XD Plugin Development folder.

You can find that folder by going to `Plugins` > `Development` > `Show Develop Folder` in the Adobe XD menu.

Beyond that, there's nothing else you have to do.  It's all written in vanilla JavaScript and has no library dependencies.
